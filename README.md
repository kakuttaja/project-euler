# project-euler

Python solutions for a few Project Euler problems I've completed with the help of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) copy-paste style.

Might have written mathematic and/or logical reasoning for some functions and variables if I've bothered. Otherwise half the fun is deciphering what the functions and variables actually are. For me as well.

And yes, I know I shouldn't have used <code>time.time()</code> for calculating a solution's runtime. Switched to <code>perf_counter()</code> at some point. Not going to update all previous solutions.
